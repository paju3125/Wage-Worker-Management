### What is WMS -
 #### A daily wage worker management system is a software application or platform designed to help organizations and businesses efficiently manage their workforce of daily wage or casual workers. These workers are typically hired on a temporary basis.

### Need of WMS - 
1. Wage Theft: This involves supervisors or managers intentionally underreporting the number of hours worked by employees or manipulating the payroll system to pay them less than they are owed.
2. Ghost Workers: Some unethical supervisors may add "ghost workers" to the payroll who do not actually work for the company, but the supervisor embezzles their wages.
3. Falsifying Overtime Hours: Managers might fraudulently approve excessive overtime hours for workers who haven't actually worked the extra hours, leading to inflated wage payments.
